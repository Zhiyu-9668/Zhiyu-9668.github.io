## Education and life experience
Born in Beijing, China <span style="color:white"> and spent a childhood happy as Maruko-chan </span><br/>
Happily finished 1-12th grades in hometown <br/>
Then left to Hefei, Anhui for [college](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), started feeling homesick <br/>
Graduated with a so-so GPA in B.S., biotechnology :P <br/>
After graduation, gapped for a year, working as research assistant [here](http://cnp.ustc.edu.cn/) <br/>
Then joined Purdue [PuLSe Program](https://www.purdue.edu/gradschool/pulse/) and started one year rotation <br/>
And settled in [this lab](https://www.bio.purdue.edu/lab/paschou/index.html) for PhD <br/>
Decided to take a dual M.S. in [stats](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/graduate/curriculum/statistics_cs.html) <span style="color:white"> Soon as I figured the tuition would be covered by the university  </span> <br/>
Anticipated to graduate from both **SOON!**
