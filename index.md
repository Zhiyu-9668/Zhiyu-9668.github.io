## Education and life experience
Born in Beijing, China <span style="color:white"> and spent a childhood happy as Maruko-chan </span><br/>
Happily finished 1-12th grades in hometown <br/>
Left to Hefei, Anhui for [college](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), started feeling homesick <br/>
Graduated with a so-so GPA in B.S., biotechnology :P <br/>
After graduation, worked as a research assistant [here](http://cnp.ustc.edu.cn/) for a year <br/>
Came Purdue and joined [PuLSe Program](https://www.purdue.edu/gradschool/pulse/) and started one year rotation <br/>
Joined [this lab](https://www.bio.purdue.edu/lab/paschou/index.html) for PhD <br/>
Decided to take a dual M.S. in [stats](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/graduate/curriculum/statistics_cs.html)
Anticipated to graduate from both **SOON!** 

## Research experience
### At Purdue 
  **Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate Research Assistant, 08/2017-present** <br/>
  Know my advisors [Prof. Peristera Paschou](https://www.bio.purdue.edu/lab/paschou/people.html) and [Prof. Petros Drineas](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/pdrineas/)
* Identifying a shared regulatory background for neurodevelopmental disorders through meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies
*	Developing novel methodologies to effectively extract and analyze information from summary statistics of genome-wide association studies

### At USTC
  **School of Life Science, Undergraduate Research Assistant, 04/2014 â€“ 06/2016** <br/>
  Know my advisors [Prof. Xiaochu Zhang](https://en.biox.ustc.edu.cn/2011/0621/c7043a340195/page.htm) and [Dr. Lizhuang Yang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Li_Zhuang_Yang)
*	Individual Differences in the Lateralization of Social Cognitive Function in the Temporo-Parietal Junction (TPJ)
*	Electrical Stimulation over Bilateral Occipito-Temporal Regions Reduces N170 in the Right Hemisphere and the Composite Face Effect
